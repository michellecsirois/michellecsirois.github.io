    <p>Thanks for stopping by. I am a software engineer with a sunny disposition and about a year of experience.
    I am available for freelance projects ranging from back-end rails development to front-end web development.
    I am most comfortable working in Rails, but I am always looking for a new challenge. If you think I might be
    able to help out you or your business, please <a href="/contact">get in touch!</a></p>
