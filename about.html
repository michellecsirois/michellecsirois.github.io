    <p>Thanks for stopping by. Born and raised just south of Boston, Massachusetts, I made my way to the west coast for
    college at the University of Southern California (fight on!). After graduating with an Industrial and Systems Engineering
    degree, I packed up my little sedan and drove to Boulder, Colorado. Once here, I was introduced to the world of Ruby on Rails.
    <br />
    <br />
    These days, I am a software engineer with a sunny disposition and about a year of experience.
    I am available for freelance projects ranging from back-end rails development to front-end web development.
    I am most comfortable working in Rails, but I am always looking for a new challenge. If you think I might be
    able to help out you or your business, please <a href="/contact">get in touch!</a></p>
